6.04	9.96	comeo Harris Let's Have a good debate
8.32	12.4	see you have fun thank
9.96	13.599	you welcome to you both it's wonderful
12.4	15.48	to have you it's an honor to have you
13.599	17.4	both here tonight good evening we are
15.48	19.8	looking forward to a spirited and
17.4	21.119	thoughtful debate so let's get started I
19.8	22.92	want to begin tonight with the issue
21.119	24.88	that voters repeatedly say is their
22.92	27.119	number one issue and that is the economy
24.88	28.679	and the cost of living in this country
27.119	30.359	vice president Harris you and president
28.679	32.439	Trump were elected four years ago and
30.359	34.800000000000004	your opponent on the stage here tonight
32.439	37.079	often asks his supporters are you better
34.8	38.76	off than you were four years ago when it
37.079	40.239000000000004	comes to the economy do you believe
38.76	44.36	Americans are better off than they were
40.239	47.038999999999994	four years ago so I was raised as a
44.36	49.48	middle class kid and I am actually the
47.039	51.28	only person on this stage who has a plan
49.48	53.64	that is about lifting up the middle
51.28	56.68	class and working people of America I
53.64	59.039	believe in the Ambitions the aspirations
56.68	61.359	the dreams of the American people and
59.039	63.199	that is why I imagine and have actually
61.359	65.32000000000001	a plan to build what I call an
63.199	68.28	opportunity economy because here's the
65.32	70.67999999999999	thing we know that we have a a shortage
68.28	72.479	of of homes and housing and the cost of
70.68	75.24000000000001	housing is too expensive for far too
72.479	78.2	many people we know that young families
75.24	81.39999999999999	need support to raise their children and
78.2	83.84	I intend on extending a tax cut for
81.4	86.159	those families of $6,000 which is the
83.84	88.56	largest child tax credit that we have
86.159	90.88000000000001	given in a long time so that those young
88.56	93.28	families can afford to buy buy a crib
90.88	97.15899999999999	buy a car seat buy clothes for their
93.28	99.24	children my passion one of them is small
97.159	101.47900000000001	businesses I was actually my mother
99.24	103.19999999999999	raised my sister and me but there was a
101.479	104.719	woman who helped raise us we call her
103.2	106.60000000000001	our second mother she was a small
104.719	109.479	business owner I love our small
106.6	112.759	businesses my plan is to give a
109.479	115.0	$50,000 tax deduction to Startup small
112.759	117.439	businesses knowing they are part of the
115.0	119.68	backbone of America's economy my
117.439	122.0	opponent on the other hand his plan is
119.68	124.64	to to do what he has done before which
122.0	127.32	is to provide a tax cut for billionaires
124.64	130.319	and big corporations which will result
127.32	132.12	in5 trillion dollar to America's deficit
130.319	135.599	my opponent has a plan that I call the
132.12	138.959	Trump's sales tax which would be a 20%
135.599	141.76	tax on everyday Goods that you rely on
138.959	144.31900000000002	to get through the month economists have
141.76	146.2	said that that Trump sales tax would
144.319	150.51899999999998	actually result for middle class
146.2	153.72	families in about $4,000 more a year
150.519	156.519	because of his policies and his ideas
153.72	159.0	about what should be the backs of
156.519	161.36	middleclass people paying for tax cuts
159.0	163.28	for billionaires president Trump I'll
161.36	165.12	give you two minutes first of all I have
163.28	167.4	no sales tax that's an incorrect
165.12	168.959	statement she knows that uh we're doing
167.4	171.84	tariffs on other countries other
168.959	173.72	countries are going to finally after 75
171.84	176.84	years pay us back for all that we've
173.72	178.959	done for the world and the Tariff will
176.84	180.64000000000001	be substantial in some cases I took in
178.959	182.72	billions and billions ions of dollars as
180.64	184.319	you know from China in fact they never
182.72	186.28	took the Tariff off because it was so
184.319	188.2	much money they can't it would totally
186.28	190.12	destroy everything that they've set out
188.2	191.79899999999998	to do they're taken in billions of
190.12	193.84	dollars from China and other places
191.799	195.68	they've left the tariffs on when I had
193.84	199.04	it I had tariffs and yet I had no
195.68	201.239	inflation uh look we've had a terrible
199.04	202.79899999999998	economy because inflation has which is
201.239	205.44	really known as a country Buster it
202.799	207.36	breaks up countries we have inflation
205.44	209.2	like very few people have ever seen
207.36	212.519	before probably the worst in our
209.2	213.959	nation's history we were at 21% but
212.519	217.159	that's being generous because many
213.959	219.36	things are 50 60 70 and 80% higher than
217.159	221.2	they were just a few years ago this has
219.36	223.43900000000002	been a disaster for people for the
221.2	225.76	middle class but for every class on top
223.439	228.07999999999998	of that we have millions of people
225.76	230.599	pouring into our country from prisons
228.08	232.87900000000002	and jails from mental institutions and
230.599	235.79899999999998	insane asylums and they're coming in and
232.879	237.92	they're taking jobs that are occupied
235.799	240.59900000000002	right now by African-Americans and
237.92	242.51899999999998	Hispanics and also iions unions are
240.599	243.879	going to be affected very soon and you
242.519	245.31900000000002	see what's happening you see what's
243.879	247.51899999999998	happening with towns throughout the
245.319	251.23899999999998	United States you look at Springfield
247.519	253.20000000000002	Ohio you look at Aurora in Colorado they
251.239	254.799	are taking over the towns they're taking
253.2	257.919	over buildings they're going in
254.799	260.88	violently these are the people that she
257.919	262.88	and Biden led into our country and
260.88	265.04	they're destroying our country they're
262.88	267.36	dangerous they're at the highest level
265.04	269.24	of criminality and we have to get them
267.36	271.52000000000004	out we have to get them out fast I
269.24	273.919	created one of the greatest economies in
271.52	276.96	the history of our country I'll do it
273.919	276.96	again and even better
